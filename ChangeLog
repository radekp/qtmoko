                                   V32
===============================================================================

Hi,
i have released new experimental qtmoko images. They are now based on debian 
squeeze and they have new (not finished) bluetooth support based on bluez4.

You can download and get more info here [1] [2].

Here are changes since v31:

- switched from debian lenny->squeeze
- switched from bluez3->bluez4
- fixed the bug in power manager (switching battery/lock/charger)
- fixed USB device/host scripts for recent kernel
- fixed default DNS
- qx can install X server (xglamo/xorg-glamo)
- X server is no longer in image
- updated omhacks
- fixed qvga in qmplayer/qmokoplayer
- GPS is now really powered down when no one uses it
- SD card image has also manual pages and other data
- qemu build host for people who want to make release themselves (see [4])
- added files and info for native compiling on ARM host

As far as i have tested - most of the stuff should be ok. But the release i 
marked experimental, because the changes are big.

Bluetooth is still work in progress. There are still some functions not 
implemented and bluetooth handsfree is bugged (see below). I was able it to 
pair with new device, you can see available services, you can use obex for 
sending/receiving/browsing, A2DP works just fine. I am not sure if works the 
scenario when headset connects to Neo, but Neo->Headset direction works. There 
is also bug that sometimes you cant see just paired device. Workaround is exit 
bt settings and enter it back.

Bluetooth handset: after pairing and connecting i can always hear phone 
ringing, i can use the buttons, but sound is there just randomly. For me it 
works somehing like this:

remove pairing with headset (if any).
reboot phone
make normal call (no bluetooth headset involved)
pair with headset
connect handsfree
make call with bt headset - sound is ok

Once it starts working it's ok. It would be nice to reproduce this bug and fix 
it. Any suggestions and findings out how to reproduce are very welcome.

As for QX - it can now install X server. You will need interenet connection. 
The xorg install should be quite ok, Xglamo install is hack, you will have to 
wait long time and it gives no output, but it should work. I'll fix it for next 
release.

Enjoy new version and bug reports are welcome (alhought i can start fixing them 
not sooner then after 3 weeks). And also patches are welcome - i dont have 
single one for this release!!!

Cheers

Radek

                                   V31
===============================================================================

Hi,
new stable qtmoko release v31 is now out. You can download images for SD card 
and NAND flash from sourceforge [1] and sources from github [2].

QtMoko is distribution for Freerunner based on debian rootfs and qtopia phone 
stack and GUI. For more info please see [3] and [4].

Changes since previous version:

- fixed invisible call button in finximod theme (Joif)
- translated to French (Gregoire Juge)
- updated Danish translation (Ole Carlsen)
- better layout in docked keyboard
- commented completion strip in docked keyboard
- VT not switch to graphics which fixes X hang in VT_WAITACTIVE (Gennady+Me)
- fix QX crash after pause/resume
- using openssh-server instead of dropbear again

This is first "stable" release based on kernel 2.6.34. I think nearly all 
regressions to andy-tracking 2.6.29 are fixed so i will tag last commit with 
2.6.29 support and will merge 2.6.34 support in master.

Docked keyboard (the one suitable for terminal) is now much better. It has 
same layout as in SHR, which means you will have cursor keys on main screen. 
The completion strip was IMO quite useless and wasted only space so it's now 
disabled.

As for the VT fix (or hack ;-) it's now possible to use any X server with QX. 
So you can install full xserver and use it instead of Xglamo which is default.

So happy new year!

Regards

Radek

===============================================================================

Hi,
qtmoko-v30 images are out now. They can be downloaded from sourceforge page 
[1].

Qtmoko is debian+qtopia based distribution for Freerunner. For more info check 
[2] [3].

For most users it's probably not worth upgrading, the changelog is very short:

- fixed headset jack detection
- Danish translations (Ole Carlsen)
- GPRS fix (Timo Juhani Lindfors)
- battery_platform for dumb batteries as module
- force GPS power up on resume (Gennady Kupava)

The headset jack can now be detected by using input device for it (patch by 
larsc that creates this device is now included in kernel).

GPRS should be now more stable thanks to Timo's fix [4]. Please test and share 
results :)

Dumb batteries could work now. You should do:

        modprobe platform_battery

or

        echo ppp_generic >> /media/card/etc/modules

to make it work. First one is for temporary test, second for permanent (reboot 
needed). I havent tried, because i dont have dumb battery so again please test 
it yourself and share results.

GPS powerup fix is probably needed only for uboot users, so i havent tested it 
also.

Last probably most important change is that qtmoko and SHR have now same 
source code. I have merged KMS patches from SHR and we have now same souce 
code (only kernel config is now different).

I have also changed a bit my kernel branches. I will have two branches for 
each release:

                                   V28
===============================================================================

Hi,
there is now new v28 release of qtmoko ready for downloading flashing and
testing. You can download it from our sourceforge page under "Experimental"
folder [1].

QtMoko is distribution for Neo Freerunner based on debian+qtopia. For more
info please check [2] [3].

This new release is based on 2.6.34 linux kernel. There are some noticable
changes since v27:

- switched from jffs2 to ubifs for better speed and performance
- qi with ubifs support and faster glamo timings (gena2x + ghislain)
- QX has it's own window manager
- QX can use qtmoko virtual keyboard
- removed qx_helper program hack
- fixed wifi bind/unbind (power on/off) devtool script (thanks to lindi)
- using dropbear instead of openssh-server
- vibrator and leds now work (lindi)
- updated omhacks (lindi)
- resume reason sysfs node is back (lindi)

Ubifs seems to have better performance. I didnt have time to do any
benchmarks, but v28 can boot in 1 minute and after booting to GUI it consumes
just 36 MB of ram.

Another advantage is that ubifs can do mmap operations which means that apt-
get now works without hacks in /etc/fstab with tmpfs for /var/cache/apt.

For booting ubifs you need to flash patched qi [4]. You can find this qi in on
download page. It has also faster glamo timing which means that graphics
should be faster now.

I did some experimental work on QX - application for running X window
applications in qtmoko. Now QX has it's own window manager. It has now only
"hello world" features, but it can be improved later. Important thing is that
X apps can be better integrated in qtmoko and we now dont need matchbox+gtk
libs installed by default which saves ~8MB in rootfs.

You can still easily use old matchbox. Just use checkbox in application
settings.

Special thanks go to lindi for work on omhacks and kernel, JaMa for figuring
out how to use ubifs and thanks also to others that i forgot to mention.

I am sorry that i didnt have time to fix your bug. Maybe for next release or
best to send your patches if you dont want to wait :)

Cheers

Radek

===============================================================================

Hi,
new experimintal qtmoko-v27 with 2.6.34 kernel is out now. You can download it
from our sourceforge page [1]

Qtmoko is distribution based on debian+qtopia, for more info see [2][3][4].

Changes from latest v26 stable release:

* New 2.6.34 kernel [5]
* GPRS fixes (Alex Samorukov and Pierre)
* Alarm fixes (Alex Samorukov)
* Using devtmpfs for faster boot and more memory

For new kernel credits go to Gennady Kupava, Lars-Peter Clausen and
Thibaut Girka. Lars for porting to newer versions and upstreaming, Gena for
help with the power consumption bug, fixing WS problems and being nice to help
anytime, Thibaut for upstreaming and blanking fix.

I have been testing 2.6.34 kernel for one week now and to me it looks ok.
There can be issues with SD card [6], the touchscreen driver is missing
filtering so it's a bit jittery and i think accelerometers are somehow strange
now.

Please report if you find any other regressions against 2.6.29. Otherwise i
will probably switch to 2.6.34 as stable kernel in next releases.

As for GPRS - it should work again and a bit better. However we still probably
need better multiplexing - plan is to use kernel gsm multiplexer.

Alarm now uses RTC_WKALM and instead of deprecated RTC_ALM and we no longer
build with BROKEN_RTC_ALARM which could cause random wakeup at night.

In the end i have decided to use devtmpfs as default /dev manager. You can
easily switch back to udev by just apt-get install udev.

I hope i havent missed anything. Please report mainly regressions again v26
version. For me this version is good enough for daily use - i hope same will
be for you.

Regards

Radek

===============================================================================

Hello,
qtmoko has new v26 release. You can get it from our sourceforge page [1].

Qtmoko is distribution for Openmoko Freerunner phone based on debian and
qtopia. You can find more info here [2] [3] [4].

Here is list of changes since previous stable version (v24):

* Fixed WS (white screen) problem in qmplayer & QX rotation (Gennady Kupava)
* Fixed unresponsive touchscreen after resume (Gennady Kupava)
* Better mass storage scripts (Alex Samorukov)
* Use blue indicator is used for wifi activity (Alex Samorukov)
* Reconnect wifi after resume (Alex Samorukov)
* Updated QtMaze with better graphics and other enhancements (Anton Olkhovik)
* We use kernel modules for bluetooth
* QMplayer supports command line arguments (Anton Olkhovik)
* QMplayer support for youtube videos (Anton Olkhovik)
* QMplayer can encode videos suitable for Freerunner's screen
* More reliable GPRS connection (Alex Samorukov)
* Dont mount /var/cache/apt for SD card images which makes apt work better
* Working for bluetooth hands free for GSM calls
* Shell scripts that are executed on suspend/resume (Piotr Gabryjeluk)
* APGS and GPS standby support (Piotr Gabryjeluk)
* Fixed "When locked" power management mode
* Bigger QTerminal (no tabs whith only one session)
* Support for A2DP bluetooth audio
* Raptor - GUI for apt package manager
* QMplayer - support for playlists (Anton Olkhovik)
* New nice theme called finximod (Joif)
* Stripped kernel modules for saving more space
* Deleted unused dejavu fonts for more space
* Use stylesheet for better html forms rendering in Arora (Ant+Alex)
* Arora supports downloading and playing youtube videos (Anton Olkhovik)
* Arora is smaller uses tab labels and better animation (Alex Samorukov)
* Tab bar size and zooming as upstream Arora does (Alex Samorukov)
* Fixed "not found error page" in Arora (Alex Samorukov)
* We have kernel sources on github [5]
* New apps - qweather (Anton Olkhovik) and qneoriod game (Bala)
* PDF support in eyepiece (Alex Samorukov)
* Fixed crashing qdictopia (Alex Samorukov)

Most of the changes dont need comments, but some require explanation.

First of all kernel fixes from Gennady deserve big credit. Finally after years
you should not see any white screen. Watching videos in qvga and rotating X
server now works flawlessly. Thanks!

Kernel sources with current .config can be found on github [5]. Updated
instructions for building are in rootfs howto [6].

You can now watch youtube videos from Arora web browser. Nice howto is here
[7]. There is currently problem that mplayer cant handle flv files. I think this
is due to changes in youtube videos format, because it worked with apt-get
installed mplayer before. But you can download the video and encode it to mp4
in qmplayer right on the device.

QtMoko should now save AGPS data before GPS is switched off (e.g. after you end
NeronGPS). After GPS is switched on, it will supply those stored data and you
will get fast fix. AGPS data is stored in /var/cache/agpsdata.

Bluetooth headsets can be now used for both audio and GSM calls. GSM calls
needed fix because of kernel bug. The fix is userspace program gta02-gsm-bt-fix
by Gabrys and is started/stoped when handsfree connects/disconnects. There is
problem that you must have incomming call first. If you make outgoing call
first, you will have no audio. This should be fixed in newer kernels but we dont
know fix for 2.6.29 kernel used in this release.

A2DP (bluetooth audio) support works too but with some glitches. You need
headset with A2DP support. After pairing press "Supported services" from
bluetooth device context menu. New button "Connect audio (A2DP)" should then
appear. Sometimes it fails to connect. For me it help putting headset in
pairing mode, restart phone and then the button works. If you make the
bluetooth audio device default it will work in all alsa programs, but expect
problems e.g. with GSM calls. If you dont make it default GSM will be ok.
However only QMplayer can detect it and use it now.

Other changes should not need more explanation, but if you would like to know
some details i will be happy to answer questions.

Thanks for everybody who helped with this release. I hope you'll like the
changes and new features.

Cheers

Radek

===============================================================================

Hi,
i have released experimental qtmoko image with 2.6.34 kernel based on debian
testing (squeeze). You can download tarbal from here [1]. There are no JFFS2
images for this release.

This version is not for daily use. I plan to release stable release short
after. Here is my list of problems:

- too high current in suspend (~20mA). Your battery will discharge sooner.
- no vibrator
- no touchscreen filtering - you see jitter e.g. in scribble drawing program
- no bluetooth (qtmoko needs bluez4 support)

On the other hand here is list of what is good:

- devtmpfs & upstart make it boot faster (90s on slow class 2 SD card)
- more packages thanks to newer debian (e.g. mencoder)
- no WS when switching vga->qvga
- more drivers - i saw something like combined usb network+usb mass storage

If you want to build yourself:

- kernel with config is here [2]
- /etc/init.d/qpe.sh needs modifications to be upstart compatible
- /etc/init.d/qpe.sh must create device nodes that devtmpfs does not create:

mknod /dev/ttySAC0 c 204 64 -m 660
mknod /dev/ttySAC1 c 204 65 -m 660
mknod /dev/ttySAC2 c 204 66 -m 660

- disable udev and enable qpe.sh:

update-rc.d qpe.sh defaults
update-rc.d -f udev-mtab remove
update-rc.d -f udev remove

- /usr/share/udhcpc/default.script needs to be launched with bash (dash does
not like the syntax for adding route)

- i need 3s rootdelay in /boot/append-GTA02

I hope some kernel developer will be successful with high power consumtion bug
[3]. I have spent quite some time to find out where is problem, but without
success. I think it's not problem of modem power management, because i have
ported modem power management from 2.6.29 kernel and nothing changed. I have
also tried to disable as many drivers as possible. I have tried booting with
qi and with uboot from both SD card and NAND, but nothing helped.

If this bug is not fixed, it IMO makes no sence to switch to 2.6.32 or higher
kernels.

Happy playing with this experimental release, thanks for feedback and stay
tuned for next stable release with bluetooth headset support, AGPS, youtube
videos and other cool features.

Regards

Radek

Hi,
new QtMoko images v24 are out! You can download from our sourceforge [1]
or visit our homepage [2][3].

QtMoko is stable distribution combining Debian rootfs and Qtopia or
QtExtended user interface.

List of changes since previous stable version (v22):

- Polish translations (Tomasz Czajkowski)
- Package manager displays package version (Anton Olkhovik)
- Disabled logging by default to save flash
- In Settings->Logging can be logging started/stopped/enabled/disabled
- GUI for modem settings (deep sleep and multiplexing) in NeoControl
- GUI for call volume in NeoControl
- Fixed gsm alsa state to use recommended "Mic 2" instead of "Right PGA"
- Wifi maxperf can be turned on/off in devtools
- Automatically set wifi to maxperf when connecting (Alina Friedrichsen)
- Automatically restart hcid if it crashed (Alex Samorukov)
- Removed setting sd_max_clk because it was causing problems (Alex Samorukov)
- Smaller icon for QNetWalk game - old icon was 1.5MB big @#!@#!
- Fixed not found page in Arora (Alex Samorukov)
- Tab bar size and zooming as upstream Arora does (Alex Samorukov)
- Enabled web cache in Arora  (Alex Samorukov)
- Switching between USB mass storage and USB ethernet via devtools
- Disabled dimming/suspend by default

Kernel for this image is still based on 2.6.29-rc3 (andy-tracking) with
custom kernel config [4] with no debug and no preemnt and most of
Freerunner hardware drivers built in + wifi fix is included.

Hi,
i have uploaded new stable QtMoko debian images [1].

QtMoko is stable distribution based on Qtopia (or QtExtended). For more info
check our homepage.

This new version is mainly bug fix release. Changes from previous version
include:

- fixed power management to correctly detect cable
- fixed GPS power up script (NeronGPS now works just fine again)
- workaround for the GSM (restart not needed now)
- added omhacks for controlling Neo hardware from command line
- new application Neocontrol for controlling Neo sysfs and other tasks
- implemented power management for locked/unlocked screen
- build fixes and code improvements (Bartlomiej Zimon)

As for the fixes: first two are quite clear. The problem with GSM not
registering can be partially solved by putting sleep after we power the modem
on. GSM registering now failed for me only first time after flashing. Then i
tried many times and haven't hit the problem again so let's hope it's fixed
now. Anyway 2.6.32 does not have this problem - so 2.6.32 is long term
solution.

Omhacks [4] is great for various low level openmoko setting. It's from Debian
and credits to it's authors. I will slowly migrate everything to use it's API.

Neocontrol is work in progress application. Most of the functionality is not
implemented yet. The switching to QVGA is only experimental and it will most
probably not work for you. Watching the sysfs is on the other hand working and
is useful.

I have also implemented power management for locked/unlocked screen. If you
set intervals to 0 in "When locked" mode - it will not be used and Qtmoko will
use suspend intervals based on power source. This feature is still quite
experiment and i think sometimes it does now properly.

As for upgrading to new version: the kernel, rootfs and all except /opt is the
same. You can just grab qtmoko-update-v22.tar.gz, stop Qtopia and unpack it.

ssh root@192.168.0.202
cd /
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtmoko/files/qtmoko-update-
v22.tar.gz/download
/etc/init.d/qpe.sh stop
tar xzvpf qtmoko-update-v22.tar.gz

Btw please check MD5SUMs:

Plans for next version remain the same except that i have now GTA01 device
(thanks to Pavel Machek), so if all goes right i will release also gta01
images.

Hope you'll like this new version

Cheers

                                   V21
===============================================================================

Hi,
today we have also new stable qtmoko images still based on andy-tracking
2.6.29 kernel. It can be dowloaded from usual location [1].

QtMoko is distribution based on Qtopia (or QtExtended) from Trolltech for your
Neo Freerunner. For more info please see homepage [2][3] or dowload source
code [4].

Here is list of changes since previous stable version (v19):

- hopefully fixed bug #80 (lost sms, thanks to Judge_Gregg's great bug report)
- SMS messages should stay on SIM now
- wifi always available after boot (OM bug #2327) thanks to Gennady for his fix.
- more sane power management values by default (suspend after 5 minutes)
- added path to /usr/games (for scummvm and other games)
- modified kernel config - all FR hardware is now build in
- in QX you can enable rotation using accelerometers
- QMplayer uses /media/card for saving media if possible

I hope there are no regressions from previous version. If yes, please let me
know i will try to fix them for next release.

I am quite scared to say it but hopefully SMS will be working 100% from now
on. I know i have told this like 3 times before, but now i had really great
bug report and i could reproduce the bug - big thanks to Judge Gregg bug
report and idea to revert the commit which was deleting SMS from SIM. Now SMS
are also kept on SIM if possible which is good.

As for QX and rotation - you can setup application (via Favourites menu) and
enable rotation. It will use accelerometers and xrandr to rotate the screen.
For me it works only when booted with uboot and still i sometimes get white
screen. But i was able to play Broken Sword in scummvm - and it's great
experience - this game rocks on Neo.

I am now using kernel config with nodebug and nopreempt. All FR's hardware is
built in and it will work even when /lib/modules are missing. Drivers for USB
devices are still as modules. You can find kernel config and wifi patch here
[5].

If you have v19 installed, you can try to upgrade without reflashing. Following
proccess is not tested but should work:

1/ download v21 tarbal
2/ replace /opt with the one in tarbal in your existing rootfs
3/ unpack /lib/modules from tarbal to your existing rootfs
4/ edit /etc/modules and delete all contents from it
5/ flash or replace kernel from tarbal (/boot/uImage-GTA02.bin)

I have a lot of plans for next version, but now enjoy new version i hope it
will serve well.

Cheers

                                   V20
===============================================================================

Hi,
i have uploaded new testing qtmoko images with 2.6.32 kernel. Current stable
images v21 are still based on andy-tracking 2.6.29 kernel - i will do anounce
for them in separate mail.

You can download as usually from [1] check homepage [2][3] and sources [4].

Here is list of changes since previous testing version (v18):

- more sane power management values by default (suspend after 5 minutes)
- workarounded stray mouse clicks in X
- backported accelerometers from andy-tracking
- backported usb host mode from andy-tracking
- wifi is now alwas available after boot
- hopefully fixed bug #80 (lost sms, thanks to Judge_Gregg's great bug report)
- added path to /usr/games (for scummvm and other games)
- modified kernel config - all FR hardware is not build in

I hope we are again closer to working phone with 2.6.32 kernel with this
release now. There are 2 things missing now:

1/ bluetooth is not powered on after resume
2/ xrandr is not working (screen goes white)

So if you are adventurous you can use this version and report bugs, otherwise
you can use v21 which can be more stable.

The kernel patches were sent to kernel mailing list and they current state can
be found here [5].

===============================================================================
                                   V19
===============================================================================

Hi,
new images version 19 of QtMoko on debian are out now! You can download from
here [1]. QtMoko is stable distribution for Openmoko Freerunner phone. For
more info visit our homepage [2][3], For source code check [4],

Here is list of changes from v16:

- Spain translation (Esteban Monge)
- Fixed compiling on systems with QT 4.6
- Fixed freeze while removing wifi-settings (Jeroen Nijhof)
- Fixed bing fonts in SMS email and others (Jeroen Nijhof)
- Fixed saving suspend interval in power management (Jeroen Nijhof)
- NeronGPS and Arora in default instalation
- Removed some demos and not working apps
- QX now suspends on call or when SMS arrives
- Workaround for incomming SMS bug
- Two kernels. Slow with debug, fast with nodebug
- Fixed web browser crashes
- Downgrade to QT 4.5.3

I have decided to do version 19 and skip 17 and 18. The reason is that i did
experimental kernel named v17 which could be confusing and i want to reserve
v18 for version with 2.6.32 kernel.

As for the changes - credits go to Jeroen for fixing bugs and Esteban for
translations, thanks a lot!

There were some troubles with QT 4.6 so for this release they are gone, but i
hope they will be back soon.

I am now also providing two kernels - one vanilla andy-tracking with debugging
stuff and one with stripped config. The first one is slow but stable. The second
one is fast, but for me it had problems with switching to QVGA (WSOD) and
sometimes wifi does not work (Suspend/resume can fix it). You can
decide which one you want to use. Just flash your favourite kernel (for jffs
image) or change the symlink in /boot (for SD card image).

Last important note on incomming SMS. I did quite dirty hack that displays on
homescreen text "1 missed sms", if modem registers new SMS but Qtopia mail
does not receive it correctly. In this case you have to restart Qtopia (Qt
Extended) and the SMS should arrive. Please tell me, if it works for you.

and enjoy new version

Regards

Radek
