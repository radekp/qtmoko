Cross compling from sources
===========================

  * Make sure you have installed on your host PC: libqt4-dev, libv4l-dev

  * You can also do fetch all build dependecies for qt:

apt-get build-dep libqt4-dev

  * Download and install toolchain

cd /
sudo wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtmoko/files/Toolchain/qtmoko-debian-toolchain-armv4t-eabi.tar.gz/download -O qtmoko-debian-toolchain-armv4t-eabi.tar.gz
sudo tar xzvpf qtmoko-debian-toolchain-armv4t-eabi.tar.gz

  * If you are on x86_64 you will need to download following 32bit libraries:

libmpfr1ldbl_XXX_i386.deb
libgmp3c2_XXX_i386.deb

     and extract the libraries from these package to /usr/lib32

  * Clone current git tree:

git clone git://github.com/radekp/qtmoko.git

  * Initialize and update submodules

cd qtmoko
git submodule init
git submodule update

  * Create build directory (you cant build from the git directory)

mkdir ../build
cd ../build

  * Build it:

../qtmoko/configure -force-build-qt -device neo
make
make install

  * Upload the result to your device (you must have phone and usb network up)

../qtmoko/devices/neo/scripts/update_qtmoko

  * If you want translations to various languages you need to checkout
    the translations git branch:

git checkout origin/translations -b translations


Compiling natively on ARM
=========================

* You need ARM device with a lot of storage 512MB of RAM (or 256MB + swap)

* Working devices are e.g. N900 or qemu armel buildhost.

* Basic buildhost can be downloaded from here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtmoko/files/BuildHost/

* Install dependencies on build host:

apt-get build-dep libqt4-dev
apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libts-dev libbluetooth-dev libasound2-dev

* Get QtMoko sources:

git clone git://github.com/radekp/qtmoko.git

  * Initialize and update submodules

cd qtmoko
git submodule init
git submodule update

  * Create build directory (you cant build from the git directory)

mkdir ../build
cd ../build

  * Build it:

../qtmoko/configure -device neo -xplatform linux-native-g++ -l dbus-1 -I /usr/include/dbus-1.0/ -I /usr/lib/dbus-1.0/include
make
make install
